# Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study

## Overview
This project is a data analytics case study aimed at understanding how **annual members** and **casual riders** use Cyclistic bikes differently. The analysis will help guide Cyclistic's future marketing strategies, specifically answering three key questions:

1. **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

This case study focuses on the first question: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

## Business Task
The primary objective is to analyze Cyclistic bike usage data and identify the differences in usage patterns between annual members and casual riders. This will help inform Cyclistic's marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Data Sources
The dataset used for this analysis includes Cyclistic trip data, which contains the following fields:
- Ride ID
- Rideable Type
- Start/End Time
- Start/End Station
- Ride Duration
- Member Type (Casual or Annual)

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis
- **Excel**: For basic exploration and cleaning tasks
- **BigQuery**: For querying and filtering large datasets
- **Tableau**: For creating visualizations
- **Google Slides (PPT)**: For presenting the final report

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. Removed duplicates and invalid data points (e.g., negative ride durations, missing station names).
2. Filtered data to include only relevant fields for analysis (e.g., ride duration, start/end times).
3. Formatted time columns to appropriate data types and calculated additional metrics such as the average ride duration.
4. Classified trips into categories: "Casual" or "Annual" based on the membership type.

## Analysis Summary
Key analysis tasks include:
- Comparing **ride durations** between casual riders and annual members.
- Identifying peak usage times for both user groups.
- Analyzing start/end stations to uncover popular locations for casual and annual riders.
- Examining seasonal or weekly trends in bike usage.

## Visualizations and Key Findings
Visualizations created in Tableau to support analysis:
- **Ride Duration Comparison**: Showcases average ride time for casual riders vs annual members.
- **Usage Heatmap**: Identifies popular stations for each user group.
- **Time-based Analysis**: Displays trends in usage by time of day, day of the week, and month.

### Key Findings:
1. Casual riders tend to take longer rides compared to annual members.
2. Annual members typically use bikes during peak commuting hours (morning and evening).
3. Casual riders often use bikes for leisure, resulting in higher weekend usage.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:
1. **Incentivize Off-Peak Usage**: Offer discounts or promotions to casual riders during non-peak hours to encourage frequent use.
2. **Promote Membership Perks**: Highlight the convenience of membership for daily commutes and offer limited-time trials to casual users.
3. **Targeted Digital Campaigns**: Use social media and email marketing to educate casual riders on the cost-effectiveness and benefits of annual membership.
